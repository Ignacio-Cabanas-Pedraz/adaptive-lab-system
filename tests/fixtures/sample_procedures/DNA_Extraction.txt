Step 1
Transfer 500µL of each spit solution to another tube

Step 2
Incubate the samples at 50ºC for 90 minutes

Step 3
Transfer 500µL incubated samples into tubes with 20µL purifying solution

Step 4
Vibrate samples on the vortex

Step 5
Embed samples in ice for 10 minutes

Step 6
Centrifuge samples 5 minutes at 14500 rpm

Step 7
Transfer 400µL of supernatant DNA

Step 8
Precipitate the DNA solution by adding 400µL of 100% ethanol 

Step 9
Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes

Step 10
Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 14500 rpm

Step 11
Discard all supernatant and leave behind the pellet

Step 12
Wash the pellet with 250µL of 70% ethanol while not disturbing the pellet

Step 13
Centrifuge the samples for 2 minutes at 14500 rpm

Step 14
Discard the supernatant leaving behind the pellet

Step 15
Dry the DNA pellet with Kim wipes by opening the samples, removing all remaining supernatant and leaving them open to dry for 20-30 minutes

Step 16
Once dry, resuspend the pellet in 100µL of Molecular Biology grade water 

Step 17 
Mix by vortexing until the pellet is dissolved in the solution
